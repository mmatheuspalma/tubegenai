# TubeGen Video Editor — Take-Home Challenge

A 24-hour take-home for the **Video Editor Engineer** role at [TubeGen](https://tubegen.ai).

You're given a working React + Vite + Remotion video editor and a demo project. Your job is to
produce the most compelling final cut you can — by adding **reusable editor primitives**, not
one-off hacks — and render it to MP4.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173 — live editor
npm run render       # renders the demo project to out/final.mp4
```

A ~35s render at 30fps takes a few minutes on a laptop; plan your render-iteration time.

## Demos

- **[Final rendered cut](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O1ac4vaimRYZo_271UrPKJxI5O9KZ2yU/view?usp=drive_link)** — the polished MP4 output (`out/final.mp4`)
- **[Video editor walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zqoLQUnj-tWkKncwM8qMrhD9I2XwiC-7/view?usp=sharing)** — how the editor works: primitives, timeline, export, and render

## Read these, in order

1. **[`CHALLENGE.md`](./CHALLENGE.md)** — the full brief: goal, deliverables, time budget, bonus.
2. **[`src/editor/extension/README.md`](./src/editor/extension/README.md)** — ★ the extension contract. How a new primitive plugs in, with worked examples. Read before writing any code.
3. **[`RUBRIC.md`](./RUBRIC.md)** — exactly how you're scored.

## How the editor works (read this)

This mirrors how TubeGen actually works, so the constraints are deliberate:

- **Scenes are fixed.** Each scene's position and duration come from `scenes.json` and are
  **locked** — you can't move, trim, or extend scenes on the timeline. TubeGen's AI lays out the
  scene timing against the voiceover; your job is to *enhance* each scene, not re-cut the edit.
- **You enhance scenes with primitives.** Transitions, camera effects, overlays, and scene types
  are all **reusable primitives** registered in `src/editor/extension/`. Pick an effect in the
  Effects tab and choose which scenes to apply it to.
- **Scene `type` matters.** A scene is `image`, `animation`, or `broll`. Types drive editing rules —
  e.g. **Crossfade only applies at the end of an `image` scene whose next scene is also an `image`**
  (a primitive declares this with an optional `canApply` predicate). The timeline plays whatever the
  file actually is (video files play; image files render as stills) regardless of the tag.
- **The playhead** follows the preview; click or drag anywhere on the timeline to scrub.

## Submission

Push everything to a **public GitHub repo** and reply to your recruiter email with:

1. Repo URL
2. Loom URL (3–5 min walkthrough)
3. Link to `out/final.mp4` (or commit it if <100MB)

Good luck — have fun with it.
